                handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

                discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and  1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by       Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very    popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum     dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
